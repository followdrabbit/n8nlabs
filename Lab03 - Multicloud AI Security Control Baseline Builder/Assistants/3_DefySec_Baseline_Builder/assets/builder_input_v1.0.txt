Title: Enforce S3 Object Ownership (Disable ACLs)
Description: Set "Bucket owner enforced" on all relevant S3 buckets to disable ACLs and centralize access via IAM.
Applicability: Amazon S3 bucket (resource-level)
Security Risk: ACLs can cause unintended public access and ownership conflicts.
Default Behavior / Limitations: ACLs may be enabled; change requires explicit configuration.
Automation: Use AWS CLI or IaC; monitor with an AWS Config rule.

Title: Disable ACLs by Enforcing Object Ownership
Description: Configure Object Ownership as "Bucket owner enforced" for all applicable S3 buckets to eliminate ACLs and rely on IAM.
Applicability: Amazon S3 bucket (resource-level)
Security Risk: Without owner-enforced mode, ACLs can reintroduce public or conflicting access paths.
Default Behavior / Limitations: Requires explicit change on existing buckets; verify impact on legacy workflows.
Automation: Apply via CloudFormation/Terraform and validate with an AWS Config custom rule.

Title: Require TLS for S3 (SecureTransport)
Description: Enforce HTTPS-only access using a bucket policy condition "aws:SecureTransport": "true".
Applicability: Amazon S3 bucket (resource-level)
Security Risk: Without TLS, data in transit can be intercepted or modified.
Default Behavior / Limitations: S3 supports HTTP/HTTPS; some legacy clients may attempt HTTP.
Automation: Add bucket policy and monitor with AWS Config managed rule s3-bucket-ssl-requests-only.
